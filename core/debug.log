APON started its journey in October, 1994 with the slogan &ldquo;An addict is sick, not bad, not mad.&rdquo; Bro. Ronald Drahozal, csc used to generate awareness in the community about drug addiction, rehabilitation and to establish the right and opportunity of all drugs users to return to a new healthy life, free of drugs. APON continues counseling, awareness and prevention activities and has developed a six and half months rehabilitation program suitable for the addicts of Bangladesh, adapting the principles of the 12 steps of Narcotics Anonymous, Therapeutic Community and other related activities, especially group sessions, for behavior change approach for both substance (drug) use and other high risk activities that could lead to HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, Tuberculosis etc. The APON rehabilitation staffs are APON graduate recovering addicts and they got many national and international certified drugs professional for many years so they are positive role models. We believe that the drug users are an integral part of society, communities; and service providers should be involved in an effective intervention to combat the drug abuse problem in Bangladesh.

Since the inception of APON, more than 5000 drug users have been admitted to APON plus hundreds of others who came or phoned for Counseling and Information. Plus over 30,000 of their family members have received services from APON, many at the Friday Family Meeting.

APON started its journey in October, 1994 with the slogan &ldquo;An addict is sick, not bad, not mad.&rdquo; Bro. Ronald Drahozal, csc used to generate awareness in the community about drug addiction, rehabilitation and to establish the right and opportunity of all drugs users to return to a new healthy life, free of drugs. APON continues counseling, awareness and prevention activities and has developed a six and half months rehabilitation program suitable for the addicts of Bangladesh, adapting the principles of the 12 steps of Narcotics Anonymous, Therapeutic Community and other related activities, especially group sessions, for behavior change approach for both substance (drug) use and other high risk activities that could lead to HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, Tuberculosis etc. The APON rehabilitation staffs are APON graduate recovering addicts and they got many national and international certified drugs professional for many years so they are positive role models. We believe that the drug users are an integral part of society, communities; and service providers should be involved in an effective intervention to combat the drug abuse problem in Bangladesh. The purpose of APON is not to make bad person good but to help a sick person to become healthy. Since the inception of APON, more than 5000 drug users have been admitted to APON plus hundreds of others who came or phoned for Counseling and Information. Plus over 30,000 of their family members have received services from APON, many at the Friday Family Meeting. APON is the only organization in South Asia that we know of, who is providing long term treatment and rehabilitation services for the male, female and children (minor) drug users.</p>', '<p style="text-align: justify;">Brother Ronald Drahozal, csc, needed a site for APON outside from the urban life, detach from the urban noise because a proper rehabilitation process depends on natural environment far from the society. A proper treatment center should provide well and healthy environment. The site is surrounded by arable land. APON is situated in green and noise-free lovely environment. APON has well equipped onefour storied building (measuring 40,000sft.) for male &amp; boy (Bahini) patients, one two storied female center of 15,000sft. for female patients above 15 years of age and one three storied building (16,500sft.) for children&rsquo;s education.
